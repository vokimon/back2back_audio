back2back - Light framework to setup back-to-back test scripts
==============================================================

This software is helpfull to prepare and managing a set 
of back2back test scripts over any piece of software 
that can be called and controlled by command line and
produces output files that can be compared against
some other reference files.

They were initially developed to do b2b tests on audio
processing algorithms by comparing audio files but now 
it is extended to many other kind of files, like plain
text and xml. Other formats can be added by extensions.

Why back to back testing
------------------------

A Back-to-back tests is a black box tests that just compares
that given an input you have the same output all the time.
Unit testing and Test Driven Development are a quite more
preferable strategy to test a piece of software.
But often we need to change a piece of software which has
been developed without proper testing.
A quick way to get control over it is setting up a set of
back-to-back tests and then proceeding with the
refactoring with a larger level of confidence.

But if b2b are hard to run and maintain, they will get old
and useless. That's where this script is useful.
* It is auto-checked, like most Xunit frameworks
* It automagically manage the expectation data
* On failure it generates proper diffs and keeps the
	failed and expected data for reference.
* Provides a handy command line to accept failed 
  results as proper ones.
* When the test turns green or it is accepted all 
  failure related data gets cleared.
* The SUT can be any shell command line (with pipes, sequences...)
* Comparators and diff generators can be added for your own file type.
* Allows to specify architecture dependant outputs for the same test.

How does it works
-----------------

A b2b test is a python script which defines a set of tests.
For each test you want to run, you need to define:
* A name
* A command line
* A set of output files to check

Just like in this b2b script:

		#!/usr/bin/python
		# Name me 'back2back', for instance
		import sys
		from audiob2b import runBack2BackProgram

		data_path="path/to/b2bdata"
		back2BackTests = [
			("myprogram_with_option",
					"./myprogram --option input1.wav input2.wav output.wav otheroutput.wav ",
					[
							output.wav",
							"otheroutput.wav",
	        ]),
			("myprogram_with_other_option",
					"./myprogram --other-option input1.wav input2.wav output.wav ignoredoutput.wav ",
					[
						"output.wav",
					]),
			]
		runBack2BackProgram(data_path, sys.argv, back2BackTests)

Save this file, for example as 'back2back' and make it executable.

To run the tests call this script without parameters.
    ./back2back

Failed cases will generate `*_result.wav` and `*_diff.wav`
files for each missmatching output, containing the
obtained output and the difference with the expected one.

If some test fail but you want to accept the new results
just call:
    ./back2back --accept case1 case2
where case1 and case2 are the cases to be accepted.

To know which are the available cases:
    ./back2back --list

To accept any failing cases (USE IT WITH CARE) call:
    ./back2back --acceptall

To accept some results but just for a given architecture,
due to floating point missmatches, use:
    ./back2back --arch --accept case1 case2
